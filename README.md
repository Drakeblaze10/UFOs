# UFOs

## Overview of Project
Using the data from UFO sightings and creating a site to filter the data. We personalized the page to our liking and used Javascript helped create a set of filters that specified the users search.

## Results
Using this site, you can now filter the data by city, country, state, shape, and date. They can then read up on the duration of the sighting and any comments related to the sighting. ![Search Table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Drakeblaze10/UFOs/main/static/images/Filters.PNG)

## Summary
The biggest drawback is the specificity needed to search the table. In order for this to be even more efficient, a recommendation would be to find the closest data, in the event the specific datapoint is not found." Or possibly to show "no results found" followed by an option to find the most relevant datapoint. Maybe later on add an option to view any images or videos (if any) would be enjoyable for any viewers to the site.
